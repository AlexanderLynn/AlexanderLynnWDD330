    <h2>What is the browser object?</h2>
    <p>
        The browser object model or <i>BOM</i> is a collection of properties and methods containing information abou the browser and computer screen. 
        Everytime a new browser window, tab, popup, frame, or iframe is created, it has a window object. This object is global in scope and can be accessed 
        from any part of the program. All globally created variables are references through the window object, although it is not necessary to reference 
        them as such.
    </p>
    <p>
        The window object also has several built in dialog boxes. When executed, these stop the execution of the program until dismissed. In the case of 
        an alert, an alert opoup is displayed and returns <i>undefined</i>. When using the <i>window.confirm()</i> method, the popup return true for ok, 
        and false for cancel. With the <i>prompt()</i> method, the value entered is returned, or if canceled, a null value.
    </p>
    <h2>Gathering client information from the browser object.</h2>
    <p>
        Within the window object, the <i>navigator</i> object returns information about a users browser and operating system. This could be useful for 
        displaying browser or machine specific content. The location property can be read or written to. When being written to, the browser will refresh 
        and navigate the the newly supplied browser. This make for a simple and easy reroute to say, a newly updated website from the old address. 
        The location object can even determine what the current protocol being used to connect to the website is and what the domain of the site is. The 
        <i>pathname</i> property will return the file path of the webpage in the current domain.
    </p>
    <p>
        The window object can even access data from outside of the currently active webpage. With the <i>history</i> property, the browser can navigate to 
        the previous webpage, or the next. This includes opening them in a new window entirely with the <i>open()</i> method of the window object. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is where the document object comes in to play. The document object is located within the window object. More specifically, this allows for 
        accessing the more familiar document object model. Here we can read and write and we have previously practiced.
    </p>
    <p>
        The document object also has some local storage capabilities, namely through cookies. Cookies are restricted to only 4KB in size, but 20 cookies 
        are allowed per domain. These are very useful for customizing the user's experience from saved preferences, recently navigated websites,a and more. 
        These cookies are made up of a text file containing simple name value pairs. Cookies can be created by using the <i>cookie</i> method of the document 
        object. Using this method simply appends a new string onto the end up the stored cookie rather than overwritting it. To overwrite a cookie, use the 
        same name but a different value.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cookies are also read using the cookie method, but without setting anything equal to its method. It will then return a list of the cookies. These can 
        also be split up by reading the key and value pairs through the <i>split()</i> method of the cookie property. By default these cookies expire at the 
        end of a browser session, but can be made persistent. To fully remove these cookies immediately, simply set the expire date to sometime in the past. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The window object also has two methods for issues callbacks after a set amount of time: the <i>setTimeout()</i> which calls a function after a set time 
        milliseconds, and the <i>setInterval()</i> which makes the call back every set interval in milliseconds.
    </p>
    <h2>HTML5 APIs</h2>
    <p>
        The data- attribute is commonly used for storing data within HTML element tags. Within this attribute can be a string with letters, numbers, hyphens, 
        dots, colons and underscores only. This can be useful for assigning data values to html objects within the DOM in situations where referencing the object 
        would be convenient, and binding them to a specific object. HTML5 also offers a Web Storage API through the property of <i>local storage</i>. Local storage 
        is accessed with getter and setter methods, both being passed in name-value pairs. It is possible to clear the local storage with the <i>localstorage.clear()</i> 
        method. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The Geolocation API is useful for obtaining the current location of the device running the browser. These are returned with the <i>navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()</i>. 
        This api can also return data such as speed, altitude, and head of the current device (scary, I know). 
    </p>
    <p>
        As we previously learned, Javascript is a single threaded language. But, with the introduction of web workers, we can run intensive tasks in the background. 
        This is extremely useful when it will take time to process a calcualtion, but you want to avoid the browser from hanging. This can be done by instantiating 
        a <i>Worker</i> object. Communication is then handled by posting message to and from the worker, essentiall running a secondar program, rather than running 
        with multiple threads. To kill the worker, the <i>worker.terminate()</i> command can be used from the outside or <i>self.close()</i> for the worker to close itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        Shared Web Workers and Service Workers also exist, albeit more complicated. Shared web workers allow functions to be handed off and run in a separate thread. 
        Service workers are also interesting in that they can intercept network traffic.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Websocket API allows for more advanced network connections. For example, a typical HTML response is only given after a request is made. What would happen if 
        the request was missed? This is what makes Websockets fantastic. They leave an open channel for communication running on a temporary server. Websockets are instantiated 
        objects that are passed in the web address of the socket. This works very similarly to event handlers. It listens for an event and runs when triggered. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The notification API allows for using system notifications! This can be requested with the <i>Notification.requestPermission()</i> function. It will then prompt 
        the user to allow or deny permission to push notifications to the device. Within a notification object, both the body and icon can be set. These notifications can even 
        be given event listeners to execute code when click on.
    </p>
    <p>
        Audio and video also have an API through the video or audio element. The <i>coontrols</i> attribute can be added to an element to add default controls such as play, 
        pause, and adjusting volume. Volume and speed can even be set programmatically, along with reading of the current play time. Many other APIs also exist for accessing 
        system data, but many are being dropped. With data privacy concerns growing, things like battery life and ambient light, for example, are being dropped support wise.
