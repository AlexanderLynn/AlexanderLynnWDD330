    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>How is data from a form retrieved?</li>
        <li>What are some of the best practices in creating forms?</li>
        <li>How are constructors written comapred to other C-syntax languages?</li>
        <li>Are there keywords such as <i>this</i>, <i>that</i>, or <i>super</i> in javascript?</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Forms</h2>
    <p>Forms are made up of controls and child elements input fields, select menus, buttons, and radio controls.<br>
    Typically a form would be submitted to a server for back end processing. With modern javascript, much more<br>
    of that procesing is being handled to the front end client.</p>
    <p>When accessing a form, the syntax <i>const form = document.forms.formName;</i> where the <i>formName</i> is<br>
    name attribute of the parent form element.</p>
    <p>When working with front end processing, many time the default submission action will want to be stopped. This<br>
    can be done with the <i>event.preventDefault()</i> method. The event handler will cause the default action to be<br>
    foregone and allow us to usa the data for something else.</p>
    <h3>Form best practices:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Name buttons with the action they complete. Don't us "submit".</li>
        <li>Placeholders can be used with labels for extra clarification.</li>
        <li>Pages that are primarily forms (think google.com) can have the first input given the autofocus attribute.</li>
        <li>When validating a form, clearly mark errors and disable the submit button</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Common input fields in HTML form are: text, password, checkbox, radio button (like check box but mutually exclusive<br>
    options), file, hidden (used for submitting data with the form that doesn't need modified by the user), text areas, and<br>
    buttons. Along with these form options we also have validation.</p>
    <p>Form validation again gives more processing over to the client acesing the webpage. It is advisable to include both front<br>
    and backend validation. A somewhat skilled user could simply change the client code to bypass a simple client side validation.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>
    <p>With the introduction of ES6, Javascripts OOP abiltiies got a big upgrade. One of the first ways is through consturctors.<br>
    Prior to ES6, object literal notation was the best way to create objects in Javascript. Now we can use constructors along<br>
    with the <i>this</i> keyword. We can also use the <i>new</i> operator to instantiate a instance of an object, similar to Java<br>
    or C#.</p>
