    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>How is data from a form retrieved?</li>
        <li>What are some of the best practices in creating forms?</li>
        <li>How are constructors written comapred to other C-syntax languages?</li>
        <li>Are there keywords such as <i>this</i>, <i>that</i>, or <i>super</i> in javascript?</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Forms</h2>
    <p>Forms are made up of controls and child elements input fields, select menus, buttons, and radio controls.<br>
    Typically a form would be submitted to a server for back end processing. With modern javascript, much more<br>
    of that procesing is being handled to the front end client.</p>
    <p>When accessing a form, the syntax <i>const form = document.forms.formName;</i> where the <i>formName</i> is<br>
    name attribute of the parent form element.</p>
    <p>When working with front end processing, many time the default submission action will want to be stopped. This<br>
    can be done with the <i>event.preventDefault()</i> method. The event handler will cause the default action to be<br>
    foregone and allow us to usa the data for something else.</p>
    <h3>Form best practices:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Name buttons with the action they complete. Don't us "submit".</li>
        <li>Placeholders can be used with labels for extra clarification.</li>
        <li>Pages that are primarily forms (think google.com) can have the first input given the autofocus attribute.</li>
        <li>When validating a form, clearly mark errors and disable the submit button</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Common input fields in HTML form are: text, password, checkbox, radio button (like check box but mutually exclusive<br>
    options), file, hidden (used for submitting data with the form that doesn't need modified by the user), text areas, and<br>
    buttons. Along with these form options we also have validation.</p>
    <p>Form validation again gives more processing over to the client acesing the webpage. It is advisable to include both front<br>
    and backend validation. A somewhat skilled user could simply change the client code to bypass a simple client side validation.<br>

    <h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>
    <p>With the introduction of ES6, Javascripts OOP abiltiies got a big upgrade. One of the first ways is through consturctors.<br>
    Prior to ES6, object literal notation was the best way to create objects in Javascript. Now we can use constructors along<br>
    with the <i>this</i> keyword. We can also use the <i>new</i> operator to instantiate a instance of an object, similar to Java<br>
    or C#. Javascript classes also support prototypal inheritance. This means that all instances of a class created have access to<br>
    the methods of the prototypes origin class. This does not mean, however, that the methods or properties cannot be overridden.</p>
    <p>While many things are similar, some are different. For instance, what is known as a class method in other C-syntax languages<br>
    is written just as a static method. This means that the method can be called by referencing the class name rather than the name<br>
    of the instance. Prototypes in Javascript also update retro-actively. Meaning if the original prototype class is updated,<br>
    with a new method, for example, all previously instantiated objects also receive the updated prototype. Javascript also handles<br>
    private and public methods and variable a little differently. There is now public or private keyword to preface objects or<br>
    classes with. Instead, Javascript relies upon setting these properties to a limited scope and using getter and setter methods<br>
    to assist in reading and writing data within the object.</p>
    <p>Some interesting ways that Javascript objects are processed include the <i>propertyIsEnumerable();</i> method, which checks<br>
    to see if a method will be counted in a for-in loop, the extends keyword, causing a new class to inherit from the class being<br>
    extended, not unique in usage nor syntax particularly to Javascript, and polymorphism. Polymorphism means objects can have the<br>
    same method names, but handle them completely differently. Like the <i>toString()</i> method outputs a single number for an<br>
    integer, yet with arrays it separates the values with commas in the output. These default methods can also be overridden by<br>
    creating another method within the class or object.</p>
    <p>To take polymorphism even further, methods can even be added to built-in objects of Javascript. For example, we could create<br>
    a method <i>isPrime()</i> and attach it to the number prototype. The line would read something like this:<br>
    <i>Number.prototype.isPrime() = function() { return for(var i = 2; i < this; i++) if(this % i === 0) return false; return this > 1;</i><br>
    Now when we write say <i>41..isPrime()</i> we will be returned a boolean true or false with the answer. This is known as<br>
    monkey-patching and is generally frowned upon in Javascript. In other lanagues however, it isn't bad at all or even positive.<br>
    To avoid modifiying built-in object, you could even create a new form of say an array called <i>betterArray</i> and have it extend<br>
    the <i>Array</i> built-in object.</p>
    <p>A mixin is a powerful way of manipulating and combining objects and methods in Javascript. With a mixin, we can combine<br>
    multiple objects together into a new object. For example, if we had a class of a superhero and the class of a alien, they both<br>
    do not have the same prototypes. But if we want to combine both fo these methods to make a super alien, someone who has all of<br>
    the methods as a superhuman, but also has alien characteristics, it can be done!</p>
    <p>Javascript's ES6 update also gave us the arrow function, extremely similar to a lambda or anonymous functions. With these<br>
    functions, it is unnecessary to declare a function name, simply the parameters being passed in. Another useful specification of<br>
    arrow functions in Javascript is that they do not decrease in scope, meaning any <i>this</i> reference refers to the originating<br>
    object.</p>
