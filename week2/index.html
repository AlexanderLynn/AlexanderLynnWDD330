        <h2>Week 2 Notes</h2>
        <h4>Questions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>What are methods I didn't know before?</li>
            <li>What things new in ES6 or ES7 did I not know before?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Javascript General Facts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Uses Comments.</li>
            <li>C-style syntax (shared with C, C++, C#, Java, Javascript and many more.</li>
            <li>Javascript has many reserved words that include, but are not limited to: abstract, await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char, class, const, continue, debugger, <br>
                default, delete, do, double, else, enum, export, extends, false, final, finally, float, for, function, goto, if, implements, import, in instanceof, int, interface, let, <br>
                long, native, new, null, package, private, protected, public, return, short, static, super, switch, synchronized, this, throw, throws, transient, true, try, typeof, var, <br>
                volatile, void, while, with, yield, undefined, NaN, and Infinity</li>
            <li>Javascript also has a few different primitive data types. For example: String, Symbol (introduced in ES6.), Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null</li>
            <li>Both variables and methods are declared with the same syntax as in other C-syntax languages.</li>
            <li>Javascript support Hexidecimal, Octademical, and binary numbers, as prefixed by the following respectively: 0x, 0o, 0b. </li>
            <li>Scientific notation is also supported: 2E3; // 2 multiplied by 10^3 (two thousand) --> 2000</li>
            <li>Not found in other C-syntax languages, infinity is used when a numebr is too large for JavaScript to handle. That limit it 1.7976931348623157e+308</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Arrays, Logic and Loops</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>the "delete" operator can be used to remove items from arrays. Example: delete avengers[3];</li>
            <li>Arrays can be "destructured" toa llow for fast swapping. This was introduced in ES6 to avoid making temporary variables. Example: [x,y] = [y,x];</li>
            <li>Javascript has many different methods for quickly manipulating arrays. Contained within them are methods such as pop, push, splice, and  join</li>
            <li>Like other C-syntax languages, Javascript also supports multi-dimensional arrays</li>
            <li>Maps were also introduced in ES6. They function similarily to an array of key and value pairs. The first being the lookup key, the second being the mapped value. For example: <br>
                const romanNumerals = new Map(); romanNumerals.set(1,'I').set(2,'II').set(3,'III').set(4,'IV').set(5,'V');<br>
                romanNumerals.get(4); --> 'IV'
            </li>
            <li>Weak Maps were also introduced in ES6. They are similar to Maps, but their keys cannot be primitives and the garbage collector will remove dead entries.</li>
            <li>Another shrothand way of writing an if else statement is witht the ternary operator. Example: const n = 5; n%2 === 0 ? console.log('n is an even number') : console.log('n is an odd number');<br>
            --> 'n is an odd number'</li>
            <li>When working with arrays, ES6 introduced the for-of loop. It is similar to the foreach loop in other C-syntax langauges. Example:<br>
                for(const value of avengers){<br>
                console.log(value);<br>
                }
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Javascript function</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In Javascript, functions are written very similarily as to other C-syntax languages. Functions are declared with the function keyword and must include parentheses.<br>
            This is true during declaration as well as calling.</li>
            <li>As introduced in ES6 (much of what is new was introduced then with small modificatiosn in ES7) the "rest" operator cna be used when an unknown amount of arguments is <br>
            pass into a function. For example:<br>
            function rest(...args){<br>
                for(arg of args){<br>
                    console.log(arg);<br>
                }<br>
            }<br>
            rest(2,4,6,8);<br>
            --> 2<br>
            4<br>
            6<br>
            8<br></li>
            <li>Javascript also included ways of establishing default arguments if nothing was passed into the function. For example:<br>
                function hello(name='World') {<br>
                console.log(`Hello ${name}!);<br>
            }<br>
            Would produce the result of "Hello World!"</li>
            <li>ES6 also introduced arrow functions. These are much les verbose than previous function declarations. Example: const hello = () => alert('Hello World!');</li>
            <li>Javascript includes hoisting within it's interpreter. This means that the function ro variable can be called before it is declared. Functions are always hoisted.</li>
            <li>When a variable declared with var is called before it is defined, the call will return undefined. When called before is declaration with let or const, it results in an error.</li>
            <li>Callbacks are also powerful alternative ways to call a function within another function. Example: if(typeof(callback) === 'function'){<br>
                callback();<br>
            }
            </li>
            <li>Super useful array method arrayName.filter(); Returns only the items that return true to the comparator inside of the parantheses. For example:<br>
                numbers.filter(x => x%2 === 0 ); // this returns true if the number is even. Only the even numbers are returned from the statement.
            </li>
        </ul>
